Greetings, fellows of the interweb!

So, after much procastination and wrestling with blogging frameworks I am making my blog live.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is what has helped me arrive here. It is a static site generator and is quite popular among developers.
[Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) is the theme used.

So, here's me looking forward to an awesome blogship :)

Stay tuned.

Cheers!
